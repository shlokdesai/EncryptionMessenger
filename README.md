# EncryptionMessenger 

What is this application:
	The Encryption Messenger is an android application that can be used to send encrypted messages between users. This application gives users multiple different encryption methods to encrypt their messages. The user can chat with a single other user, or create groups with other users.
	
Why I used the specific technologies for this application:
	I have created this application with the help of Android Studio and Firebase Realtime Databases. I created this application to dive into the more advanced areas of android development, and used Android Studio as it was the platform I was familiar with. I also wanted to gain the experience of working with databases, and after much trial and error with different database systems thought that the Firebase Realtime Database was the right database system for my use case. Because the Firebase Realtime Database is a cloud hosted NoSQL database, I thought it would be appropriate for me who was trying to learn how to implement databases into my applications. The Firebase Realtime Database is a NoSQL database that stores data in the form of key values, and is also non relational, this directly effected the difficulty level of development and led to the optimal learning experience for a learner like myself.
	
Difficulties I faced while creating this application and the future of this project:
	While making a simple messenger was a simple task using firebase, creating a messenger with enceryption proved to be a more difficult task. In the future I hope to include image/video/audio messaging and also hope to improve the UI/UX of the application. More specifically, I would need to find encryption systems for the three formats of data to maintain the security aspect of the application. I am looking forward to creating a more proffesional looking login page and messaging interface for the application too.
